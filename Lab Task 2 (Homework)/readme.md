## 1. Display Table
This notebook demonstrates how to display the multiplication table for a number using both `while` and `for` loops.

### Code Structure:
- **Input**: A number from the user.
- **Logic**: Two implementations:
  - `while` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and print the table.
  - `for` loop to achieve the same result.

## 2. Swap Two Numbers
This notebook explores methods to swap two numbers with and without using a temporary variable.

### 2.1 Basic Swap
The first part of the notebook covers a simple swap where the values of two variables are exchanged without any logic, i.e., the values are manually swapped.

#### Code Structure:
- **Input**: Two numbers from the user.
- **Logic**: The values of `a` and `b` are swapped and printed.

### 2.2 Logical Swap
This section swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.

#### Code Structure:
- **Input**: Two numbers from the user.
- **Logic**: Uses a temporary variable `temp` to hold the value of one variable and swaps the two.

### Additional Formatting:
- **String Formatting**: Demonstrates two ways to display the swapped results:
  - Simple print method.
  - Using `str.format()` to neatly format the output string.

## 3. Swapping Numbers Using Two Variables
This notebook demonstrates how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable, relying on arithmetic operations instead.

### Code Structure:
- **Input**: Two numbers from the user.
- **Logic**: The values are swapped using addition and subtraction.
  - `a = a + b`
  - `b = a - b`
  - `a = a - b`

### Instructions to Run the Notebooks:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Open the notebook files:
   - `1. Display Table.ipynb`
   - `2. Swap Two Numbers.ipynb`
   - `3. Swapping Number Using Two Variables.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions within each notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
