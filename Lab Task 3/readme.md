# BBQ Weather Dataset Analysis

This repository demonstrates how to load and analyze BBQ weather data using Python's `pandas` library. The dataset (`data.csv`) contains daily weather information across various European cities, showing whether the weather conditions were suitable for BBQ on each date. This information can be useful for studying weather patterns or planning outdoor events.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide a hands-on example of data loading and initial inspection using the `pandas` library. It also serves as a tutorial for anyone wanting to explore a basic dataset related to weather conditions across various cities. The dataset spans multiple dates and cities, and each entry indicates whether the weather was favorable for a BBQ.

This repository is ideal for those who:
- Are learning how to manipulate CSV datasets with Python.
- Want to explore weather data and its relation to outdoor activities.
- Need a basic template for loading datasets and doing initial exploration.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`Loading Dataset Practice.ipynb`**:
   - A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to load the `data.csv` file and conduct some initial data inspection.
   - It includes examples of:
     - Importing necessary Python libraries (like `pandas`).
     - Loading the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
     - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
     - Basic data analysis functions such as checking for missing values, understanding the data types, and summary statistics.

2. **`data.csv`**:
   - A CSV file containing BBQ weather data from various cities.
   - **Columns**:
     - `DATE`: The date of the observation, in the format `YYYYMMDD`.
     - `*_BBQ_weather`: Columns that indicate BBQ weather conditions for specific cities on that date. If the weather was suitable for BBQ, the value is `True`; otherwise, it's `False`.
     - Cities included: BASEL, BUDAPEST, HEATHROW, DRESDEN, DUSSELDORF, KASSEL, LJUBLJANA, MAASTRICHT, MALMO, MONTELIMAR, MUENCHEN, OSLO, PERPIGNAN, SONNBLICK, STOCKHOLM, TOURS, and others.

## Data Description

The BBQ weather data spans a range of dates, with daily observations for each city. Each city's BBQ weather conditions are recorded as a boolean value (`True` or `False`), where:
- `True`: The weather was suitable for BBQ on that particular date.
- `False`: The weather was not suitable for BBQ.

### Example Data (First Five Rows)

| DATE     | BASEL_BBQ_weather | BUDAPEST_BBQ_weather | HEATHROW_BBQ_weather | ... | STOCKHOLM_BBQ_weather | TOURS_BBQ_weather |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 20000101 | False             | False                | False                | ... | False                 | False             |
| 20000102 | False             | False                | False                | ... | False                 | False             |
| 20000103 | False             | False                | False                | ... | False                 | False             |
| 20000104 | False             | False                | False                | ... | False                 | False             |
| 20000105 | False             | False                | False                | ... | False                 | False             |

The data starts from the year 2000, and each row corresponds to a specific date, listing whether BBQ-friendly weather was observed in the various cities.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Python libraries:
  - `pandas` (Install via `pip install pandas`)

You can install Jupyter by running:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd bbq-weather-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loading\ Dataset\ Practice.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to load and inspect the dataset.

## Example Code Snippets

Here are some example code snippets to get you started with using the data:

- **Loading the Dataset**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   # Load the dataset from the CSV file
   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   ```
- **Previewing the Data**:
   ```python
   # Display the first five rows of the dataset
   df.head()
   ```
- **Checking for Missing Values**:
   ```python
   # Check for any missing values in the dataset
   df.isnull().sum()
   ```
- **Basic Summary Statistics**:
   ```python
   # Get basic statistics about the dataset
   df.describe()
   ```

## Potential Use Cases

- **Weather Analysis**: This dataset can be used to study weather patterns across various cities. You can analyze trends, compare weather conditions across different locations, or explore the frequency of BBQ-suitable days over time.
  
- **Event Planning**: The dataset can help event organizers plan outdoor events by identifying the most favorable weather periods for BBQs in different regions.
  
- **Machine Learning Applications**: You can build predictive models to forecast BBQ-suitable weather based on historical data or weather patterns.
